abstract = "Background
automatic recognition of human movement is an effective strategy to assess abnormal gait patterns. Machine learning approaches are mainly applied due to their ability to work with multidimensional nonlinear features.
Purpose
to compare several machine learning algorithms employed for gait pattern recognition in motor disorders using discriminant features extracted from gait dynamics. Additionally, this work highlights procedures that improve gait recognition performance.
Methods
we conducted an electronic literature search on Web of Science, IEEE, and Scopus, using “human recognition”, “gait patterns’’, and “feature selection methods” as relevant keywords.
Results
analysis of the literature showed that kernel principal component analysis and genetic algorithms are efficient at reducing dimensional features due to their ability to process nonlinear data and converge to global optimum. Comparative analysis of machine learning performance showed that support vector machines (SVMs) exhibited higher accuracy and proper generalization for new instances.
Conclusions
automatic recognition by combining dimensional data reduction, cross-validation and normalization techniques with SVMs may offer an objective and rapid tool for investigating the subject's clinical status. Future directions comprise the real-time application of these tools to drive powered assistive devices in free-living conditions."

The packaging of papaya fruit as per its maturity status is an essential task in the fruit industry. The manual grading of papaya fruit based on human visual perception is time-consuming and destructive. The objective of this paper is to suggest a novel non-destructive maturity status classification of papaya fruits. The paper suggested two approaches based on machine learning and transfer learning for classification of papaya maturity status. Also, a comparative analysis is carried out with different methods of machine learning and transfer learning. The experimentation is carried out with 300 papaya fruit sample images which includes 100 of each three maturity stages. The machine learning approach includes three sets of features and three classifiers with their different kernel functions. The features and classifiers used in machine learning approaches are local binary pattern (LBP), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes respectively. The transfer learning approach includes seven pre-trained models such as ResNet101, ResNet50, ResNet18, VGG19, VGG16, GoogleNet and AlexNet. The weighted KNN with HOG feature outperforms other machine learning-based classification model with 100% of accuracy and 0.0995 s training time. Again, among the transfer learning approach based classification model VGG19 performs better with 100% accuracy and 1 min 52 s training time with consideration of early stop training. The proposed classification method for maturity classification of papaya fruits, i.e. VGG19 based on transfer learning approach achieved 100% accuracy which is 6% more than the existing method."

This work evaluates advantages and limitations of statistical and machine learning methods to predict failures in industrial robots. The work is based on data from more than five thousand robots in industrial use. Furthermore, a new approach combining standard statistical and machine learning models, named hybrid gradient boosting, is proposed. Results show that the hybrid gradient boosting achieves significant improvement as compared to statistical and machine learning methods. Furthermore, local joint information has been identified as the main driver for failure detection, whereas failure classification can be improved using additional information from different joints and hybrid models."

Subjective classification of gait pattern in children with cerebral palsy depends on the assessor's experience, while mathematical methods produce virtual groups with no clinical interpretation.
Methods
In a retrospective study, gait data from 66 children (132 limbs) with a mean age of 9.6 (SD 3.7) years with cerebral palsy and no history of surgery or botulinum toxin injection were reviewed. The gait pattern of each limb was classified in four groups according to Rodda using three methods: 1) a team of experts subjectively assigning a gait pattern, 2) using the plantarflexor-knee extension couple index introduced by Sangeux et al., and 3) employing a fuzzy algorithm to translate the experiences of experts into objective rules and execute a clustering tool. To define fuzzy repeated-measures, 75% of the members in each group were used, and the remaining were used for validation. Eight parameters were objectively extracted from kinematic data for each group and compared using repeated measure ANOVA and post-hoc analysis was performed. Finally, the results of the clustering of the latter two methods were compared to the subjective method.
Findings
The plantarflexor-knee extension couple index achieved 86% accuracy while the fuzzy system yielded a 98% accuracy. The most substantial errors occurred between jump and apparent in both methods.
Interpretation
The presented method is a fast, reliable, and objective fuzzy clustering system to classify gait patterns in cerebral palsy, which produces clinically-relevant results. It can provide a universal common language for researchers."

Quantitative gait analysis produces a vast amount of data, which can be difficult to analyze. Automated gait classification based on machine learning techniques bear the potential to support clinicians in comprehending these complex data. Even though these techniques are already frequently used in the scientific community, there is no clear consensus on how the data need to be preprocessed and arranged to assure optimal classification accuracy outcomes.
Research question
Is there an optimal data aggregation and preprocessing workflow to optimize classification accuracy outcomes?
Methods
Based on our previous work on automated classification of ground reaction force (GRF) data, a sequential setup was followed: firstly, several aggregation methods – early fusion and late fusion – were compared, and secondly, based on the best aggregation method identified, the expressiveness of different combinations of signal representations was investigated. The employed dataset included data from 910 subjects, with four gait disorder classes and one healthy control group. The machine learning pipeline comprised principle component analysis (PCA), z-standardization and a support vector machine (SVM).
Results
The late fusion aggregation, i.e., utilizing majority voting on the classifier's predictions, performed best. In addition, the use of derived signal representations (relative changes and signal differences) seems to be advantageous as well.
Significance
Our results indicate that great caution is needed when data preprocessing and aggregation methods are selected, as these can have an impact on classification accuracies. These results shall serve future studies as a guideline for the choice of data aggregation and preprocessing techniques to be employed."

The aim of this study was to evaluate supervised machine learning algorithms in the classification of sagittal gait patterns for CP children with spastic diplegia. Gait parameters were extracted from gait data obtained from two hundred children with spastic diplegia CP, and were used to represent the key kinematic features of each individual's gait. Seven supervised machine learning algorithms including an artificial neural network (ANN), discriminant analysis, naive Bayes, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest were compared by constructing a gait classification system based on the same gait data. The performance of these algorithms was then evaluated using a standard 10-fold cross-validation procedure. The results show that the ANN has the best prediction accuracy (93.5%) with a low resubstitution error (5.8%), high specificity (>0.93) and high sensitivity (>0.92). The decision tree algorithm, SVM, and random forest approaches also have high prediction accuracy (>77.9%) with low resubstitution error (<14.3%), moderate specificity (>0.5) and moderate sensitivity (>0.2). The discriminant analysis, naive Bayes and KNN methods have relatively poor classification performance. Given these results for classification performance and prediction accuracy, the ANN is a good candidate for gait classifications for CP children with spastic diplegia. The decision tree is also attractive for clinical applications due to its transparency. Supervised machine learning algorithms can potentially be integrated into an expert gait analysis system that can interpret gait data and automatically generate high-quality analyses."

Sufficient joint torque required for each limb during stance and swing phases were estimated among the subjects with weights and relevant attributes analyzed using attribute evaluators. The validation of this data was performed by pattern reconstructions in a gait simulation platform and testing whether they reproduced gait phases. Gait data categorization allowed kinematics and dynamics to be mapped to male and female subjects allowing differentiation between the genders.

Characterisation and classification of different common gait disorders such as foot drop in an effective and accurate manner can lead to improved diagnosis, prognosis assessment, and treatment. However, currently visual inspection is the main clinical method to evaluate gait disorders, which is reliant on the subjectivity of the observer, leading to inaccuracies. Research question: This study examines if it is feasible to use commercial off-the-shelf Inertial measurement unit sensors and supervised learning methods to distinguish foot drop gait disorder from the normal walking gait pattern. Method: The gait data collected from 56 adults diagnosed with foot drop due to L5 lumbar radiculopathy (with MRI verified compressive pathology), and 30 adults with normal gait during multiple walking trials on a flat surface. Machine learning algorithms were applied to the inertial sensor data to investigate the feasibility of classifying foot drop disorder. Results: The best three performing results were 88.45%, 86.87% and 86.08% accuracy derived from the Random Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes classifiers respectively. After applying the wrapper feature selection technique, the top performance was from the Random Forest classifier with an overall accuracy of 93.18%. Significance: It is demonstrated that the combination of inertial sensors and machine learning algorithms, provides a promising and feasible solution to differentiating L5 radiculopathy related foot drop from normal walking gait patterns.

Gait signal is one of the best features to characterize and detect movement disorders caused by a malfunction in parts of the brain and nervous system of the patients with PD. Various classification approaches using spatiotemporal gait variables have been presented earlier to classify Parkinson’s gait. In this study we propose a novel method for gait pattern classification between patients with PD and healthy controls, based upon phase space reconstruction (PSR), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and neural networks. First, vertical ground reaction forces (GRFs) at specific positions of human feet are captured and then phase space is reconstructed. The properties associated with the gait system dynamics are preserved in the reconstructed phase space. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been used. These measured parameters demonstrate significant difference in gait dynamics between the two groups and have been utilized to form a reference variable set. Second, reference variables are decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using EMD, and the third IMFs are extracted and served as gait features. Third, neural networks are then used as the classifier to distinguish between patients with PD and healthy controls based on the difference of gait dynamics preserved in the gait features between the two groups. Finally, experiments are carried out on 93 PD patients and 73 healthy subjects to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. By using 2-fold, 10-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation styles, the correct classification rates are reported to be 91.46%, 96.99% and 98.80%, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the results demonstrate superior performance and the proposed method can serve as a potential candidate for the automatic and non-invasive classification between patients with PD and healthy subjects."

The method involved features translated as sum vectors and then using a simple neural network where gait data was normalized and classified the swing or stance. Sum-vector neural network-based method allowed a significantly higher test accuracy compared to the other machine learning algorithms.

To support the most effective integration of these technologies in health professions, it is helpful to understand which features are most important in classification. Twenty individuals walked with combinations of an asymmetric leg length using a shoe with a small or large height and/or an asymmetric distal mass using a small or large ankle weight. These conditions changed the resultant gait of participants to impose asymmetric gait impairments. Different classifiers such as Support Vector Machines with different kernel functions were trained to classify leg length into 3 classes and distal mass into 5 classes using spatial-temporal, kinematic, and kinetic features, and evaluated for every combination of three features. Push-off force asymmetry was found to be an important feature in the classification of both leg length and distal mass. Asymmetry with regards to minimum knee angle, maximum hip extension, and the first vertical peak resulted in the best model for classifying leg length with an accuracy of 64.8%. Asymmetry with regards to braking force, push-off force, and vertical work resulted in the best model for classifying distal mass with an accuracy of 69.9%. The results suggest that the optimal features vary according to the specific impairment."

abstract = "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people around the world. Diagnostics tools based on the clinical symptoms have been developed by the scientific community mostly in the last decade. This study proposes a new method of PD detection from gait signals, using artificial neural networks and a novel technique framework called Neighborhood Representation Local Binary Pattern (NR-LBP). Vertical Ground Reaction Force (VGRF) readings are preprocessed and transformed using several methods within the proposed framework. Statistical features are extracted from the transformed data, and the Student's t-test test is used to create different feature sets. A simple artificial neural network is trained over these features to detect PD, and its performance is evaluated using different metrics. Classification accuracy of 98.3% and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.959 are obtained, indicating high-performance classification. Based on these performance measures, the proposed NR-LBP algorithm is compared to the regular LBP algorithm and found to be contributing positively to classification performance when various types of transformations are used in combination."

abstract = "While diagnosing Parkinson’s disease (PD), neurologists often use several clinical manifestations of the subject and rate the severity level based on the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). This kind of rating largely depends on the expertise of the doctors, which is not only subjective but also inefficient. Hence, in this paper, a machine learning based gait classification system which can assist the clinician to diagnose the stages of PD is presented. Gait pattern, which plays a significant role in assessing the human mobility, is a significant biomarker to classify whether the subject is healthy or affected with PD. Hence, we utilize the vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) gait dataset and extract the minimal feature vector using the statistical analysis. Subsequently, the normal distribution of the data is validated using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and from the spatial and temporal features of gait pattern, the salient biomarkers are identified using the correlation based feature selection technique. Four supervised machine learning algorithms namely decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), ensemble classifier (EC) and Bayes classifier (BC) are used for statistical and kinematic analyses which predict the severity of PD. The classifier efficacy quantified using the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity highlights that the proposed framework can effectively rate the severity of PD based on Hohen and Yahr (H&Y) scale. Moreover, comparing the accuracy of the proposed PD classification approach with those of the other state-of-the-art approaches, which utilized the same gait dataset, reveal that the proposed method outperforms several other PD classification methods."

abstract = "Automated recognition of gait pattern change is important in medical diagnostics as well as in the early identification of at-risk gait in the elderly. We evaluated the use of Kernel-based Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) to extract more gait features (i.e., to obtain more significant amounts of information about human movement) and thus to improve the classification of gait patterns. 3D gait data of 24 young and 24 elderly participants were acquired using an OPTOTRAK 3020 motion analysis system during normal walking, and a total of 36 gait spatio-temporal and kinematic variables were extracted from the recorded data. KPCA was used first for nonlinear feature extraction to then evaluate its effect on a subsequent classification in combination with learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs). Cross-validation test results indicated that the proposed technique could allow spreading the information about the gait’s kinematic structure into more nonlinear principal components, thus providing additional discriminatory information for the improvement of gait classification performance. The feature extraction ability of KPCA was affected slightly with different kernel functions as polynomial and radial basis function. The combination of KPCA and SVM could identify young–elderly gait patterns with 91% accuracy, resulting in a markedly improved performance compared to the combination of PCA and SVM. These results suggest that nonlinear feature extraction by KPCA improves the classification of young–elderly gait patterns, and holds considerable potential for future applications in direct dimensionality reduction and interpretation of multiple gait signals."

The gaits of 12 young and 12 elderly participants were recorded and analysed using a synchronized PEAK motion analysis system and a force platform during normal walking. Altogether, 24 gait features describing the three types of gait characteristics were extracted for developing gait recognition models and later testing of generalization performance. Test results indicated an overall accuracy of 91.7% by the SVM in its capacity to distinguish the two gait patterns. The classification ability of the SVM was found to be unaffected across six kernel functions (linear, polynomial, radial basis, exponential radial basis, multi-layer perceptron and spline). Gait recognition rate improved when features were selected from different gait data type. A feature selection algorithm demonstrated that as little as three gait features, one selected from each data type, could effectively distinguish the age groups with 100% accuracy. These results demonstrate considerable potential in applying SVMs in gait classification for many applications."

abstract = "Ageing has an effect on many parameters of the physical condition, and one of them is the way a person walks. This property, the gait pattern, can unintrusively be observed by letting people walk over a sensor floor. The electric capacitance sensors built into the floor deliver information about when and where feet get into close proximity and contact with the floor during the phases of human locomotion. We processed gait patterns recorded this way by extracting a feature vector containing the discretised distribution of occurring geometrical extents of significant sensor readings. This kind of feature vector is an implicit measure encoding the ratio of swing-to stance phase timings in the gait cycle and representing how cleanly the leg swing is performed. We then used the dataset to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron to perform regression with the age of the person as the target value, and the feature vector as input. With this method and a dataset size of 142 persons recorded, we achieved a mean absolute error of approximately 10 years between the true age and the estimated age of the person. Considering the novelty of our approach, this is an acceptable result. The combination of a floor sensor and machine learning methods for interpreting the sensor data seems promising for further research and applications in care and medicine."

To harness the power of these data and make research more efficient, modern machine learning techniques are starting to complement traditional statistical tools. This survey summarizes the current usage of machine learning methods in human movement biomechanics and highlights best practices that will enable critical evaluation of the literature. We carried out a PubMed/Medline database search for original research articles that used machine learning to study movement biomechanics in patients with musculoskeletal and neuromuscular diseases. Most studies that met our inclusion criteria focused on classifying pathological movement, predicting risk of developing a disease, estimating the effect of an intervention, or automatically recognizing activities to facilitate out-of-clinic patient monitoring. We found that research studies build and evaluate models inconsistently, which motivated our discussion of best practices. We provide recommendations for training and evaluating machine learning models and discuss the potential of several underutilized approaches, such as deep learning, to generate new knowledge about human movement. We believe that cross-training biomechanists in data science and a cultural shift toward sharing of data and tools are essential to maximize the impact of biomechanics research."

The classification process was based on measurements from a single wearable sensor using a total of 41,780 strides from eleven recreational runners while running in real-world and uncontrolled environment. Biomechanical variables included pelvic drop, ground contact time, braking, vertical oscillation of pelvis, pelvic rotation, and cadence were recorded during running on three inclination grades: downhill, −2° to −7°; level, −0.2° to +0.2°; and uphill, +2° to +7°. An ensemble and non-linear machine learning algorithm, random forest (RF), was used to classify inclination condition and determine the importance of each of the biomechanical variables. Classification accuracy was determined for subject-specific and group-based RF models. The mean classification accuracy of all subject-specific RF models was 86.29%, while group-based classification accuracy was 76.17%. Braking was identified as the most important variable for all the runners using the group-based model and for most of the runners based on a subject-specific models. In addition, individual runners used different strategies across different inclination conditions and the ranked order of variable importance was unique for each runner. These results demonstrate that subject-specific models can better characterize changes in gait biomechanical patterns compared to a more traditional group-based approach."
