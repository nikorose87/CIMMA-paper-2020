\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
Machine learning applications has become a very important area of research in recent years. This is due to the advantages provided by machine learning algorithms in a great variety of fields, such as biomedicine \cite{marker}, biometric security \cite{KECECI2020931}, sport science \cite{SHENG2020107480}, material science \cite{SELVARATNAM2020}, agriculture \cite{papaya} or robotics \cite{robotics}, among others, as they allow to analyze and compare large amounts of information quickly and accurately.
\\
As the world's population ages, pathologies and disorders diagnosis using machine learning has presented a growing interest, as it has been demonstrated it's effectiveness to early diagnose gait disorders and pathologies objectively by analysing and comparing patients data \cite{marker,BEGG2005401,KOKKOTIS2020100069,FIGUEIREDO20181,DARBANDI2020189,SLIJEPCEVIC2020198,YURDAKUL2020102070,E2020106494,SHARIFBIDABADI2019234}; and from gait processing, age-related mobility diseases can be detected early \cite{BEGG2005401,HOFFMANN2018271,HALILAJ20181}, thus, treatments and rehabilitation processes can be developed faster, improving patients' life quality.
\\
Gait pattern classification using machine learning algorithms can be perfomed in several ways \cite{FIGUEIREDO20181}, which may differ from the classification algorithm used, being the most common SVM, k-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks and Naive Bayes \cite{marker,FIGUEIREDO20181,SLIJEPCEVIC2020198,ZHANG201933, NUTAKKI2020395, SHARIFBIDABADI2019234,ZHOU2020105486}; feature extraction technique applied, like PCA and kPCA \cite{marker,FIGUEIREDO20181,SLIJEPCEVIC2020198,WU2007393}, wrapper method \cite{SHARIFBIDABADI2019234}, MRF\cite{ZHOU2020105486}, PSR-based \cite{ZENG201964} or Sum-Vector analysis \cite{BABU2020403}; or selected input features for the algorithm, such as subject kinetic, kinematic and dynamic data \cite{marker,KECECI2020931,NUTAKKI2020395, SCHLAFLY2019100163}, GRFs \cite{YURDAKUL2020102070,E2020106494}, IMU and EMG \cite{KECECI2020931,SHARIFBIDABADI2019234,ZHOU2020105486} data.
\\
In order to achieve an accurate and reliable age group classification based on gait pattern features, these and other parameters must be properly selected before building training and testing classifier data sets, as every input feature is related differently to the output target, same algorithm hyperparameters may not be useful for different input features, or evaluating model performance with improper metrics or data may lead to classifying over fitting \cite{SLIJEPCEVIC2020198,HALILAJ20181,AHAMED2019227}. The above implies tha to develop the correct age group classification depending on gait pattern features, the combination of feature extraction, tuning of hyperparameters and selection of the classifier algorithm must be properly established. As the consulted state of the art indicates, gait pattern-based age group classification is generally developed by using SVMs or Random Forest classifiers, combined with PCA or kPCA feature extraction to improve classifier accuracy \cite{BEGG2005401,FIGUEIREDO20181,AHAMED2019227}. Nevertheless, the variety of classifiers used is due to the need of multi-class age group classification for majority of the research developed on this topic. For this reason, if the classification task is of a binary nature, e.g. classification between young and adult population, it is possible to opt for the use of a lower computational cost algorithm such as logistic regression based classifier.
\\
In the present research, we developed an age group classifier for young and adult population on Python, using a logistic regression classifier with PCA feature extraction for 40 random reconstructed kinetic and kinematic subject data (20 youths and 20 adults) using mean and standard deviations from healthy subjects' gait reference information obtained by the research conducted on \cite{bovi2011multiple}.
\\
First, we take the information contained in Joint Rotations, Ground Reaction Forces, Joint Moments and Joint Power Excel file sheets from \cite{bovi2011multiple} supplementary material workbook and generate 20 random samples per feature, using zero mean sample reconstruction method for each mean and SD movement task (walking at natural speed (N), walking very slow (XS), walking slow (S), walking medium (M), walking fast (L), walking on toes (T), walking on heels (H), stair ascending (U) and stair descending (D)); taking into account that for each feature, there are 18 movement task columns, with the first 9 belonging to young subjects data, and the remaining 9 belong to adult subjects data. Then, reconstructed data is reindexed to set each column as a feature and the rows as the samples for each subject movement task. Thirdly, target output is built, assigning 0 to young population output and 1 to adult population output. Subsequently, an iterative PCA feature extraction, hyperparameter tuning and logistic regression classifier training and testing process is developed in order to evaluate the minimum number of Principal Components needed to achieve an accuracy score greater or equal than 0.98. Afterwards, classifier output confusion matrix, first 3 PCs data distribution, PCs vs Accuracy score and PCs explained variance ratio is plotted. Finally, results are discussed and conclusions are presented.
\\
The present article is structured as follows: on section \ref{sect_2}, \ref{sect_3}, \ref{sect_4}. Conclusions are presented on section \ref{sect_5}
