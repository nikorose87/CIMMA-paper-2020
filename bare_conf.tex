\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
Machine learning (ML) applications has become a very important area of research in recent years. This is due to the advantages provided by ML algorithms in a great variety of fields, such as bio-medicine \cite{marker}, bio-metric security \cite{KECECI2020931}, sport science \cite{SHENG2020107480}, material science \cite{SELVARATNAM2020}, agriculture \cite{papaya} and robotics \cite{robotics}, among others, as they permit the analysis and comparison of large amounts of data, faster and accurate.
\\
Moreover, human gait pathologies and disorder diagnosis using ML has presented a growing interest, demonstrating its effectiveness in interpreting \--- better than professionals \--- those kind of pathologies objectively, by analysing and comparing patients raw data \cite{marker,BEGG2005401,KOKKOTIS2020100069,FIGUEIREDO20181,DARBANDI2020189,SLIJEPCEVIC2020198,YURDAKUL2020102070,E2020106494,SHARIFBIDABADI2019234}. Furthermore, the older the world population becomes, the more raw data related with age-related mobility diseases is being obtained and reported for their reuse, and thus, better precision detecting those disorders  \cite{BEGG2005401,HOFFMANN2018271,HALILAJ20181}.  Therefore, treatments and rehabilitation processes will be developed faster with reliable data, improving patients Quality of Life (QoL) in third-world countries especially.
\\
Gait pattern classification using ML algorithms is performed in several ways \cite{FIGUEIREDO20181}, in which SVM, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Naive Bayes (NB) \cite{marker,FIGUEIREDO20181,SLIJEPCEVIC2020198,ZHANG201933, NUTAKKI2020395, SHARIFBIDABADI2019234,ZHOU2020105486} are the most common used algorithms applied in this field. With respect to feature extraction, algorithms like PCA and kPCA \cite{marker,FIGUEIREDO20181,SLIJEPCEVIC2020198,WU2007393}, wrapper method \cite{SHARIFBIDABADI2019234}, MRF\cite{ZHOU2020105486}, PSR-based \cite{ZENG201964} or Sum-Vector analysis \cite{BABU2020403} are the preferred ones. The performance on each will depend on the kind of input feature to be studied, such as subject kinetics, kinematics \cite{marker,KECECI2020931,NUTAKKI2020395, SCHLAFLY2019100163}, GRFs \cite{YURDAKUL2020102070,E2020106494}, IMU and EMG \cite{KECECI2020931,SHARIFBIDABADI2019234,ZHOU2020105486} data.
\\
In order to achieve an accurate and reliable pathological group classification, based on gait pattern features, a pre-processing stage must be set properly before fitting the data, as every input feature is related \--- in different proportion \--- to the output target, preserving the same algorithm hyper-parameters may not be useful for different input features. Also, evaluating model performance with improper metrics or data may lead to inaccurate results (i.e over fitting) \cite{SLIJEPCEVIC2020198,HALILAJ20181,AHAMED2019227}. The above implies to develop correct classification results regarding: the gait pattern features, the combination of feature extraction, hyper-parameters tuning and selection of the suitable classifier algorithm. 
\\
This study will be focused on age-group classification of able-bodied subjects. As the consulted state of the art indicates, gait pattern-based age group classification is generally developed by using SVMs or Random Forest classifiers, combined with PCA or kPCA feature extraction to improve classifier accuracy \cite{BEGG2005401,FIGUEIREDO20181,AHAMED2019227}. Despite the fact that most of these algorithms are able to solve multi-class classification problems, they are not the more efficient for binary nature problems, e.g. classification between young and adult population, thus it is possible to opt for the use of a lower computational cost algorithm such as logistic regression based classifier.
\\
In this work, we reused reliable pre-processed human gait data to develop an age group classifier for young and adult population, disregarding their gait intention or speed, using a logistic regression classifier with PCA feature extraction. As in this study the mean and standard deviations of 40 subjects healthy subjects (20 youths and 20 adults) were reported, the kinetic and kinematic subject data  was reconstructed using the gait reference information obtained by the research conducted on Bovi et al. work\cite{bovi2011multiple}.
\\
First of all, we take the information contained in the supplementary material workbook of this paper, and generate 20 random samples per feature, using zero mean sample reconstruction method for each mean and SD movement task speed (natural (N), very slow (XS), slow (S), medium (M), fast (L), walking on toes (T), walking on heels (H), ascending (U) and descending (D)); taking into account that for each feature, there are 18 movement task columns, with the first nine (9) belonging to young subjects data, and the remaining belong to adult subjects data. Then, reconstructed data is re-indexed to set each column as a feature, and the rows as the samples for each subject movement task. Second of all, target output is built, assigning 0 to young population output and 1 to adult population output. Subsequently, an iterative PCA feature extraction, hyperparameter tuning and logistic regression classifier process is developed in order to evaluate the minimum number of Principal Components needed to achieve an accuracy score greater or equal than 0.98. Afterwards, We demonstrated that classifying age-group data, diregarding the gait intention or speed, is possible with binary classification algorithms, like logistic regression, after applying feature reduction technique as PCA.
\\
